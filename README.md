# Sales Trend Analysis For a Pizza Outlet

## Power-bi Dashboard Link: https://mavenanalytics.io/project/7939

### Project Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop an illustrative dashboard for a year's worth of sales from a fictitious pizza place, including the date and time of each order and the pizzas served, with additional details on the type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients. The dashboard should provide great insights and should give answers to the following questions raised by our client:

-  How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?

-  How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?

-  How much money did we make this year? Can we identify any seasonality in the sales?

-  Are there any pizzas we should take of the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?

### Approach:

To achieve these objectives. We utilized Microsoft Excel to clean the the data and the data transformation was completed using power query. The dashboard was created using the power-bi after creating relationships between the tables provided.

### Insights

-  The revenue trend shows fluctuations throughout the year, with some months experiencing positive growth and others facing negative changes.

-  Thai Chicken pizza generated $43,424 in total sales and Classic Deluxe had 2329 total orders.

-  The Brie Carre pizza is the least popular in terms of total orders and revenue generated. Considering its performance, it may be worth evaluating whether      to keep it on the menu.

### Recommendations

-  To address the fluctuations in revenue, consider running targeted promotions or discounts during months with lower sales to improve sales .
-  Identify factors that led to decline in the month of June and august, then take corrective measures to improve sales during that period in the next fiscal     year.
-  Capitalize on the positive growth months(February, April, July and November) by introducing new products and offering seasonal promotions to attract           customers.
-  To increase customer frequency, consider implementing a loyalty program offering rewards or discounts to frequent customers.
-  Leverage the popularity of Thai Chicken and Classic Deluxe pizzas by introducing combo deals that include these bestsellers along with sides and drinks.
-  For the least popular pizzas, conduct customer surveys to understand the reasons for their low demand and consider rebranding or modifying these pizzas        based on customer preferences.
-  Promote the XXL pizza size by offering limited discounts to encourage customers to try it, potentially increasing revenue from larger orders.
-  We can improve overall business performance and customer satisfaction by incorporating these recommendations and monitoring its impacts.
